    "\n",
    "C1: The purpose of this dashboard was to be able to provide context for internal stakeholders as it pertrained to customer statistics vs our competitiors. Over the past few assignments we have been analyzing our internal data but still have not comapred our data to an external dataset to see where we stand against our competitors. The dashboards are functioning as our comparison to the industry. In my inital search for a dataset to use in this analysis finding another set of data that had matching columns to our churn_clean and matched our own data dictionary was my primary objective. I was able to find one and really wanted to make sure that I was able to do an Apples to Apples comparison, so I made sure to remove rows that would were not included on both. For example instead of an age column our external dataset had wether a customer was a senior citizen or not. There was also survey satisfaction data that was included on the churn_clean.csv and not on the other so those columns were omitted for that reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "C2: The variables in the additional dataset enhance our insights due to the similarity in the responses I saw in the rows. The external dataset had many of the same products that our company offers; (ie, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup) so I thought this would be a great dataset to use. One of the downsides to this dataset is that it only contained 7043 unique responses so certain numbers may be skewed and could potentially tell a story that is not true, so I had to be very careful in the data insights I did choose to use in my recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "C3: One insight that executives can use to enhance insights would definitely be the customer payment types. I work in FinTech and this is a deliverable I am responsible for each quarter as we try to dissuade customers from using slower payment methods such as checks. An executive would be able to use this specific representation to judge where we stand in terms of getting slower paying customers to opt for electronic methods as well as if our competitors are running into the same issue. Another key insight would be the monthly charge text table found on the Customer Contract data. Even with the skewed data our customers pay twice as much to retain services through us compared to the competitor data. On average a higher majority of our customers tend to be subscribed to more than one item compared to our competitors which could explain this, but it would defintiely be something I would recommed that senior management look into.\n",
    "\n",
    "C4: On the Customer Contract data tab a user is able to modify the datasets to select between competitor vs WGU telecom co. This would provide two seperate looks with only data from each of the respective companies being considered for a more straight forward analysis. Moreover, on the Consumer Products tab users are able to select different internet types in order to see how various payment methods compare. Lastly a user has the ability to click on any dashboard if they are looking for insights comapred to a certain product and will get a display focused on that specific insight. Users can also select the escape if they would like to revert back to the original version of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "C5: In order to ensure that colorblind users are able to also use this dashboard I made sure to use the color blind palette when I was doing various graphs, which is why all of the dataset graphs are the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "C6: One of the stories I wanted to be able to tell is that we have more customers who pay by check than our competitors. Looking at the dataset 23% of our customers pay by check which for comaprison would put us in line with our competitors who check represents 23% of their payment method as well, with the key difference of almost 3000 less responses. This would lead me to recommend to senior management that we would need to have our representatives continue to push an electronic method. Another representation I wanted to tell is on the Customer Contract Data is being able to use the monthly charge each month to back into how likely a customer is to churn selecting any charge on there will show you how often someone churned in the past tweleve months based on their contract type. This is another important KPI for senior management in order to figure out which demographic is most likely to churn based on their contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "C7: The audience I used for this analysis was a senior management team, that would be focused on items that move the needle, due to this I made sure to keep the recommendations short in order to leave time for questions that would be had by the senior management. Alternatively working in finance I have to deal with making sure that I talk about items that lead to a material impact. This led to me focusing on more subscription based services we offer. I would adapt this if it was for a specific department in order to make sure that the items being discussed are things that they deal with in their day to day.\n",
    "\n",
    "C8: Using a colorblind palette allows for everyone to be able to view the same color spectrum, moreover the panopto video will allow for people who are blind or have vision impairments to also understand what is going on. Lastly I have uploaded this item on a public website to allow all audiences to access and engage with the data analysis tools free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "C9: I wanted to ensure that I was able to keep the attention of senior management as they are busy with multiple things throughout their day so I made sure to keep topics brief and focused on the bottom line which impacts the company directly. I also added in visuals to ensure alongside the brief storytelling to assist with being able to understand some of the more complex insights. "
